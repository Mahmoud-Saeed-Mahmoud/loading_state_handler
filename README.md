## Dart and Highlight.js Integration

This repository contains two JavaScript files:

**docs.dart.js:** 
- Provides utilities for copying and mixing properties between JavaScript objects.

**highlight.pack.js:** 
- A library for syntax highlighting of code snippets. This is a pre-packaged version of Highlight.js (v11.8.0).

**Purpose:** 

These files are likely used together to enable syntax highlighting within a Dart application. The `docs.dart.js` file could provide functionality for customizing highlighting behavior, while `highlight.pack.js` performs the actual code syntax highlighting.

**Note:** This README provides a basic overview of the files' purpose. For specific details on functionality and usage, please refer to the individual files or their respective documentation.
